# Plan — making pmai solve prompts faster with fewer tokens

Findings from running 13 sample coding workflows (`test/cases`) through pmai on
`gemma4:31b` (Ollama cloud, `env-ollamacloud.sh`) with a logging proxy between
pmai and the endpoint, so every request body, tool schema, tool call and usage
figure of every run is on disk (`test/results/<run>/<case>/proxy.jsonl`).
`test/README.md` explains the harness; `doc/proxy.md` covers the tool proxy.

Each item is a todo. Ticked items were fixed in this pass, one commit each, so
the commit log (`git log b75177e..`) can be reviewed alongside this file.
Unticked items are proposals with the measurement that motivates them. Where a
proposal removes code, that is said explicitly: the preferred outcome for
MaiCore is fewer lines, not more.

## 1. Where the tokens go

Single runs, 13 tasks each, native tool calling unless noted. Numbers are the
sum over the 13 tasks; a single run is noisy (the same task took 18 model calls
once and 7 the next time because the model chose to bookkeep with `todo_*`).

| configuration | solved | model calls | prompt tokens | wall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| native tools, before fixes | 11/13 | 84 | 402k | 85s |
| native tools, after fixes (two runs) | 13/13, 12/13 | 76, 83 | 334k, 386k | 86s, 103s |
| text protocol, before | 0/13 (40 turns each) | ~40/task | ~200k/task | ~30s/task |
| text protocol, after | 13/13 | 115 | 454k | 141s |
| xml protocol, after | 12/13 | 91 | 352k | 93s |
| json protocol, after (two runs) | 12/13, 12/13 | 132, 97 | 582k, 341k | 130s, 110s |
| tool proxy, before | 4/13 (5 refusals) | 49 | 107k | 91s |
| tool proxy, after | 8/13 | 128 | 167k | 168s |
| toolDelegation subagent | 13/13 | 86 | 454k | 81s |
| **after the catalog cut (section 3)** | | | | |
| native tools | 12/13 | 89 | 242k | 81s |
| text protocol | 11/13 | 101 | 234k | 97s |
| toolDelegation subagent | 12/13 | 94 | 311k | 84s |

The catalog cut took the fixed cost per call from 23 tools / 16.1k characters
(3,756 prompt tokens on the first call) to 17 tools / 8.9k characters (2,153),
and the text-protocol prompt from 12.8k to 7.2k characters. The remaining
failures after the cut are the `13-big-log` shell mistake the model makes every
time, the `10-readme` respond dump in the text protocol (section 4), and, in
the first sweep only, `07-find-usage`: the benchmark's work directory is
git-ignored and `files_grep` searched nothing, which `fb248bf` fixes; the case
passes again in 2 calls.

Three facts decide everything below:

- **The fixed cost per call is 74–85% of all prompt tokens.** The 23 standard
  tool schemas are 16k characters (~3.7k tokens) and are resent on every call.
  Across the baseline run that is ~316k of 402k tokens. The conversation itself
  (user prompt, tool calls, tool results, answers) is the remaining ~86k.
- **Wall time is round trips.** Model time equals wall time within 3%; tools
  are instant on these tasks. Each call costs 0.5–1.2s on the cloud endpoint,
  so a 7-call task takes 6s and a 40-call loop 30–100s. Fewer turns is the
  only way to be faster.
- **Output is tiny.** 5–8k completion tokens per 13 tasks. Nothing to gain
  there; everything is on the input side.

## 2. Bugs fixed in this pass (one commit each)

- [x] **Text/xml/json protocols never finished a task** (`b75177e`). Ollama
  parses gemma's own function-call syntax into native `tool_calls` even when
  the request offers no tools. The loop read only the text, saw no call,
  appended `missing_tool_call` feedback and asked again, until `maxModelTurns`.
  Every task: 40 calls, ~160–200k tokens, nothing done. Native calls in a text
  protocol now run like any native turn. After: text 13/13, xml 12/13, json 12/13.
- [x] **Every tool result was sent twice** (`87cef61`, `6b81c1b`). Each result
  carried a `<structured_content>` JSON copy of its text: a `files_list` result
  was more than doubled, `files_read` appended offsets, `run_sh` appended the
  absolute cwd and a duration, on every later request of the run. Structured
  content now goes out only when a result has no text (MCP tools that answer
  with structured data alone).
- [x] **Prompt prefix changed on almost every request** (`ba09ecf`).
  `JSONValue.compactJSONString` used an unsorted encoder, so the same message
  rendered differently each time: 57 of 71 consecutive requests in the baseline
  run differed from the previous one somewhere in the middle. Any server-side
  prompt cache (llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama) misses from that message on. Sorted keys.
- [x] **Tool proxy refused work** (`749db0d`). With only `list-tools` and
  `call-tool` visible, 5 of 13 tasks ended with "I do not have access to your
  file system". The proxy definitions now list the enabled tool names (~120
  tokens); `list-tools` ranks name matches first and describes at most six
  tools in full (a broad search returned 10.9k characters before).
- [x] **Tool proxy nested envelope** (`381901c`). gemma sends
  `{"name":T,"arguments":{"name":T,"arguments":{…}}}`; the inner envelope
  reached the tool, `path` was "missing", the identical call repeated 40 times.
- [x] **Glued tool names** (`3a1655f`, run-loop lookup `64f5ece`).
  Servers hand over names like `run_sh Optimize:` or `files_read:`. The
  resolver now tries the leading identifier, and the run loop uses the resolver
  too (text protocols offer no tools, so the provider's resolver is empty).
- [x] **Empty reply killed the run** (`55fb63c`). A swallowed malformed call
  returns empty content; the provider threw, the loop retried twice with 5s
  pauses and failed the whole task. Three tasks died this way. Mid tool loop an
  empty reply is now repair feedback, not a retry.
- [x] **The identical-call guard did not end anything** (`564e280`). It
  refused the 4th identical call with an error, then the model repeated it 36
  more times (~150k tokens). Once the guard trips, the next turn gets no tools
  and a note to answer with what it has.
- [x] **Empty replies in a row were also endless** (`dd85f41`). Same treatment
  after three consecutive empty replies; the error also carries its message again.
- [x] **Native `respond` in a text protocol** (`c36ca7b`). The text prompt
  offers a `respond` pseudo-tool; when a server returns it as a native call it
  was "not available to this agent". It is the final answer now.
- [x] **Tool proxy made hybrid** (`9ffb9e3`, `e2a74f3`). The pure proxy
  solved 5–8 of 13 tasks: the model called hidden tools by name (swallowed by
  the server), escaped file bodies twice, and wrapped calls in every envelope
  shape. The six common tools stay native, the rest sit behind `list-tools`
  whose description is generated from them; 12/13 at two thirds of the native
  tokens. `doc/proxy.md` has the study.
- [x] **Tool output noise** (`8f4f777`). The call line showed raw JSON (a
  `files_write` printed the whole escaped file) and the result hid under a
  heading. Calls are one readable line (`→ files_read cli.py`,
  `→ files_patch path=… find=… (+1 lines) replace=…`), results start right
  after `←`, errors read `← Error: …`; the same renderers serve child-agent
  blocks and the visual mode. Still open: `ui.toolResultLines` defaults to all
  lines, so a 500-line read floods the terminal; a default of ~40 with the
  `… N more lines` tail is probably right, and `ui.subagents` could gain a
  `results` level (results only, no calls) to match what people read.

## 3. Tool catalog: the 3.7k tokens paid on every call

Done in this pass, one commit each; the schema set went from 23 tools and
16,098 characters to 17 tools and 8,940 characters (−44%), the text-protocol
prompt from 12,812 to 7,163 characters, and MaiStandardTools lost more lines
than it gained.

- [x] **Duplicate tools removed** (`818b499`, `613f4cf`). `read_text_file`
  duplicated `files_read`; `run_system` duplicated `run_sh`. Gone, with their
  schemas (~1.1k characters per call).
- [x] **One run tool** (`613f4cf`). `run_python` and `run_js` (used once in 300
  calls) are folded into `run_sh`; other languages go through the shell
  (`python3 - <<'EOF' … EOF`). The `runPython`/`runNode` options went with them.
- [x] **`files_read_document` merged into `files_read`** (`8b68ed5`): `.pdf`
  and `.docx` are converted to Markdown, everything else, JSON included, stays
  the raw text a model can patch. The iOS host lost only the removed name.
- [x] **`files_chdir` removed** (`ffd1fa8`). Every path argument takes a
  relative or absolute path; `/cd` stays for the person at the prompt.
- [x] **Path convention said once** (`67413d5`). `files_list` states it; every
  other path argument is "File path." and each tool has a one-sentence
  description without the workspace name (~1.3k characters per call).
- [x] **Rare search arguments dropped** (`67413d5`). `files_find` lost `depth`,
  `include_ignored`, `limit`; `files_grep` lost those and `case_sensitive`,
  with the implementation that served them. Defaults: smart case, 100 matches,
  source paths only. Follow-up (`fb248bf`): a folder the repository ignores
  now falls back to the filesystem walk instead of "No matching lines."
- [x] **Budget met.** Target was ≤ 8k characters for the coding set; the
  `files` + `run` groups are 7.9k, `todo` adds 1.0k. First-call prompt tokens
  3,756 → 2,153; a 13-task sweep 334–386k → 242k prompt tokens with the same
  model calls.
- [x] **Todo tools slimmed** (`2b8d876`). `todo_done` takes several items per
  call, `todo_add`/`todo_done` answer in one line instead of echoing the list,
  and the descriptions say "work of five or more steps". The group stays in
  the default set; measure whether to drop it from coding agents once the
  system prompt (section 6) exists.
- [x] **Delegation described truthfully, agent_* schemas halved** (`06edcea`).
  `AgentDelegation.swift` claimed the subagent mode hides the concrete tools;
  the runtime and `doc/agents.md` keep them and add `agent_*`, and that is
  what the comment says now, with its cost. The four schemas went from ~3.2k
  to ~2.4k characters. Still open: the mode delegated nothing in 26 tasks;
  section 8 decides whether it earns its place.
- [ ] **Not yet verified on iOS.** `PocketMai/Services/ToolAgent.swift` and
  `FileWorkspaceService.swift` only lost references to the removed name, but
  the app was not built in this pass.

## 4. Text protocols

- [ ] **The text prompt is as heavy as the schemas.** The generated
  `## Available Tools` block is 12.8k characters (~3k tokens) per call, built
  from the same descriptions. Every item in section 3 shrinks it too.
- [ ] **Repair feedback advertises `respond` and models take the hint.** After
  a swallowed `files_write`, the feedback says "You may also call respond with
  final content"; in two runs the model then *answered with the README text*
  instead of writing the file (xml `10-readme`, json `10-readme`). Drop the
  `respond` example from `missingPostToolActionMessage`; consider removing the
  `respond` pseudo-tool entirely (`AgentToolLoopPolicy.responseToolDefinition`
  and its parsing paths): a plain answer is already the final answer. Negative LOC.
- [ ] **Repair feedback is appended as an assistant message.** The model then
  continues after "its own" `<tool_run>missing_tool_call…` block. Measure a
  user-role variant on the same 13 tasks; keep whichever needs fewer repairs.
- [ ] **Text protocols do not stream** (`stream: usesTextToolProtocol ? false`).
  Tool calls arrive whole anyway, but the final answer is not streamed either,
  so the user waits the whole generation. Stream and parse the buffered text at
  the end.
- [ ] **The text protocol is textual only on the way in.** The model's
  `TOOL_CALL` block is stored as a native `tool_calls` message and the result
  as a `tool` role message. That is what primes gemma to switch to its native
  function-call syntax on the next turn, which some servers swallow (the empty
  replies above). Option: keep the exchange textual end to end (result as a
  user-role `<tool_run>` block) for servers that do not parse tool calls, and
  measure the empty-reply rate.

## 5. Context debt and KV-cache friendliness

The user's framing: protocol scaffolding is a per-prompt need, not history; and
there are two different optimisation targets that should be selectable and
measured separately, context size (rewrite/prune old messages) versus cache
reuse (append only, never touch old messages).

- [x] **`context: cache | size` on the agent** (`f843dc7`, `8455b59`; `/set
  context`, runner `--context`). `cache`, the default, never changes a sent
  message; `size` prunes as described below. `analyze.py` reports a *prefix Δ*
  column (requests that changed something the previous request already
  carried): 0 in cache mode on every run, 1–4 in size mode, all of them the
  rewrites. Autocompact stays as configured in both modes (it is off by
  default and an explicit choice when on).
- [x] **File bodies collapse to a reference in size mode** (`f843dc7`,
  `8455b59`). `AgentContextPruning` replaces a `files_read` body with
  `[cli.py: 24 lines, 572 characters, read earlier and removed from the
  context; call files_read again if needed]`, as a transcript edit the REPL
  shows as `✂ context`. **Measured, and the first version was wrong:** pruning
  bodies read two results ago *inside the same run* made the model re-read
  them when it wrote the answer (`01-explain`: 10 calls and 27k tokens instead
  of 7 and 18k in one run, neutral in the other; every other task reads too
  few files for it to fire). Two size-mode sweeps totalled 206k and 214k
  prompt tokens against 215k and 206k in cache mode: a wash on single-prompt
  tasks. So the current prompt's reads now stay untouched and only bodies
  read for *earlier* prompts collapse, which is where the debt accumulates in
  a long chat. Open: a multi-prompt benchmark case (the runner is one-shot) to
  measure that saving, and extending the rule to long `run_sh` outputs of
  earlier prompts.
- [x] **Context tools removed** (`150afc7`). Never called in 900+ model calls
  while costing four schemas on every call of the default agent. The edit
  types, the editor and the `transcriptEdited` event stay for the automatic
  pruning above; the tools, their supervisor queue and the runtime drain are
  gone (−400 lines).
- [x] **Tool results carry what the next step needs** (`240c9a5`, `cc2e74a`).
  `files_replace_range` names the resulting line range ("now lines 5-12 of
  19") and its description steers to `files_patch`; `files_grep` says in its
  text when it stopped at 100 matching lines (the structured flag no longer
  reaches the model, and a proxy run had counted the 100 lines as the total).
- [x] **`run_sh` keeps 24 KB per stream instead of 100 KB** (`41df7e2`). The
  truncation note says how much was dropped; head, tail or grep get the rest.
- [x] **Exploration nudges** (`dc3e68e`): `files_list` says it lists one folder
  and points at `files_find` with `*` for the whole tree; `files_find` says so
  too. No new tree tool: `files_find` already does it. Still open: a
  `files_read` that takes several paths (one call instead of four for a small
  package), and the system prompt line "grep first, read ranges" (section 6).
- [x] **Prefix stability measured after the fixes:** 0 of 66 consecutive
  native requests and 0 of 88 text-protocol requests change their prefix (57 of
  71 did before). Within a run nothing before the last message moves:
  autocompact defaults to 64k tokens, the project-instructions and
  memory blocks are set between prompts and fixed for the run, and the
  text-protocol prompt sits in a stable second system message. Add
  `compare.py`'s prefix figure to every sweep (done in `analyze.py`).

## 6. The default prompt

- [ ] **"You are a helpful assistant. Use tools when needed." is the entire
  coding prompt.** Every workflow mistake above is a mistake the prompt did not
  forbid. Write one compact coding prompt (≤ 600 characters) and measure it
  with `run.py --system FILE`: grep before reading, read a range not a file,
  `files_patch` not rewrite, run the tests once at the end, do not re-read what
  a diff already showed, no `todo_*` for fewer than five steps, answer in a few
  lines. Keep it as the `main` default for pmai and PocketMai.
- [ ] **Model errors that a prompt line can catch.** `13-big-log` failed
  twice on the same shell mistake (`cut -d' '` on a message containing spaces
  gave "timeout waiting for upstream (req=998)" as the top error): one line
  "check aggregate results against the raw data before answering" is cheap to
  test.

## 7. Runtime guards and errors

- [ ] **A stuck run still burns the turn budget until the guard trips.**
  Consider a "no progress" rule: N consecutive tool errors of the same kind
  (not only identical calls) withdraws the tools as well.
- [ ] **`files_patch` needs `replace_all`.** Every multi-match rename cost two
  turns ("Expected 1 patch matches, found 4", then `expected_matches`). A
  boolean saves a turn per file.
- [ ] **Unknown argument keys are dropped silently**, then the error says "No
  fields were given" (`Tooling.swift:321`). Name the unknown keys so the model
  can fix the shape in one turn (this is how the nested envelope hid).
- [ ] **`maxModelTurns` default 50 and `maxToolCalls` default 100** means a runaway run costs
  ~200k tokens before stopping. With the guards above 20–25 is enough for
  these tasks; make the default smaller or budget by tokens.

## 8. Subagents

- [ ] Measured only the `subagent` delegation mode (section 3). Next: a case
  that *needs* delegation (a repo too large to read in one context; two
  independent sub-tasks), run with explicit `subagentNames` and a worker whose
  tools are the files/run groups, and compare parent tokens and wall time
  against inline. Record `agent_start` briefs and child transcripts
  (`/export debug` carries them) to judge whether the brief template
  (`AgentDelegationPrompt.template`) gives children what they need without
  repeating the parent's context.
- [ ] Decide the delegation semantics (hide or not) before adding anything;
  see the mismatch in section 3.

## 9. Benchmark harness todos

- [ ] Repeat each sweep 3× and report medians; single runs vary by ±15% on
  totals and by 2× on individual tasks.
- [ ] More cases: a multi-file feature, a repo large enough that reading
  everything is impossible (forces grep/ranges), a change that breaks a test
  elsewhere, a long conversation that triggers autocompact, and one that needs
  a subagent.
- [ ] Other models: `gpt-oss:120b`, `qwen3.5:397b`, `kimi-k2.7-code` on the
  cloud; `qwen3-coder:30b` locally (`127.0.0.1:11434`) for the small-model
  view where text protocols matter most.
- [ ] Add a `--prompt-variant` matrix (default vs coding prompt) and a
  `--context-mode` switch once section 5 lands, so both can be compared on the
  same runs.
- [ ] Guard the harness against killed sweeps: launching several `run.py`
  in one shell and exiting killed the proxy runs twice; run them as separate
  jobs or wait on all of them.

## 10. Parallel and recursive subagents: asynchronous tool calls

The user's report: agents ran one at a time (the parent waited for each
`agent_start` before the next one ran), a worker could not start workers, the
`agent_*` descriptions did not push the model towards standalone tasks, and
nothing asked for a plan before a multi-step request. The fix is one concept,
not four special cases: an **asynchronous tool call**. Cases `14`–`16` (below)
and `analyze.py`'s new columns (`agents`, `par`, `async`, `plan`, `depth`)
measure it; `run.py --plan on|off` toggles `use.plan`.

- [x] **`ToolAnnotations.concurrent`: a call the run starts and does not wait
  for.** `AgentRuntime.runInternal` runs a reply's calls in order, but a call
  to a concurrent tool is started in a task group and left running while the
  next call starts; results join the transcript in call order once the last
  is in. A `LaunchGate` holds the next concurrent call until the previous one
  is under way (child registered, tool invoked), so pids and slots follow
  call order. All four `agent_*` tools are concurrent; everything else stays
  sequential unless a plugin says otherwise. Two `agent_start` calls in one
  reply now overlap (test: a barrier both children must reach). The iOS tool
  loop (`AssistantToolLoop.runToolCalls`) does the same.
- [x] **`wait: false` is the async form, and the answer comes by itself.**
  `AgentProcessTools.run` ends a background child with
  `supervisor.finish/fail(..., deliver:)`, which posts the answer (or the
  reason it ended) into the *parent's* inbox in the same actor step; the
  parent's run reads it at its next model turn like a queued message, marks
  the child collected and emits `childFinished`. `agent_result` still works
  for taking the answer early and drops the pending delivery. Nothing polls.
- [x] **A run does not end while it has live children.** When the model
  answers with no calls and a child is still working, the run holds
  (`awaitAnyChild`, 100 ms poll) and asks the model once more with the
  delivery in the transcript. A one-shot `pmai "…"` no longer exits on top of
  its own children, and a worker cannot answer its parent while its own
  children run. The old "child running across orchestrator turns" test now
  checks the new contract (later turns still own a child when a limit ended
  the run first).
- [x] **Workers are peers.** The derived worker inherits the parent's
  delegation mode, subagents and tool groups, so it can hand work down in
  turn; `limits.maxSubagentDepth` stops the recursion, and at the depth
  limit the agent tools are not offered at all (`visibleDefinitions(for:depth:)`),
  so leaf workers never pay the ~2.4k characters of `agent_*` schemas on
  every call. iOS: `SubagentTool.childSettings` withholds `canSpawnSubagents`
  only at the leaf depth.
- [x] **Descriptions that steer.** `agent_start` now says the child is
  self-contained (it cannot see the conversation, so `context` must carry
  what it needs), one concrete task, "independent tasks: start them all in
  the same reply, they run at once", "a child may start children of its own",
  and that a `wait: false` answer arrives later as a message. `agent_result`
  is described as the early-collection tool, not the way answers come back.
  The `agents` group description (`/tools show agents`) says the same.
- [x] **`/set use.plan` (`ConfiguredUse.plan`, default on).** Appends one
  sentence to `agent_start`: for a request with several steps, write a short
  numbered plan before the first `agent_start`, saying which steps go to
  children and which run in parallel; a single question needs no plan. It is
  a tool-description sentence, not a system block, so an agent that cannot
  start children pays nothing. iOS: "Plan before delegating" in the Agents
  screen (`AppSettings.plansBeforeDelegating`).
- [x] **Harness.** Cases `14-parallel-fixes` (three independent script bugs),
  `15-overview-fanout` (four packages, one paragraph each), `16-two-repos`
  (a Python test and a JS check in unrelated trees); `run.py --plan`; the
  analyzer's `agents`/`par`/`async`/`plan`/`depth` columns read the proxy
  log (a child request is one whose brief says "running as agent '…'").

### Measured

Single runs on `gemma4:31b` unless noted (Ollama cloud); cases 11, 14, 15, 16
unless noted; `plan` counts runs where the parent's first tool-calling reply
had text before its calls. Wall time is left out: two single cloud calls
stalled for ~199 s in this sweep (one in `inline`, one in `plan off`, one in
a child of `17`), which swamps everything else. Run ids are
`test/results/async-*`; the findings file with per-case detail is in the
session scratchpad and summarized here.

| configuration | solved | calls | prompt Σ | agents | par | async | plan | depth |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| inline | 3/4 | 40 | 113k | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/4 | 0 |
| subagent, plan on | 4/4 | 38 | 141k | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/4 | 0 |
| subagent, plan off | 3/4 | 43 | 151k | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/4 | 0 |
| subagent, plan on, system prompt asks to delegate independent parts | 4/4 | 35 | 121k | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0/4 | 1 |
| subagent, system prompt asks to delegate *and* to plan first (cases 14–16) | 2/3, one 300 s stall | 29 | 116k | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0/3 | 1 |
| gpt-oss:120b, subagent, plan on | 3/4 | 95 | 240k | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/4 | 0 |
| `17-fanout-directed` (three `wait:false` starts asked for) | 1/1 | 22 | 50k | 3 | 3 | 3 | – | 1 |
| `17`, gpt-oss:120b | 0/1, four HTTP 500s | 27 | 48k | 2 | 2 | 1 | – | 1 |
| `18-fanout-delivered`, before the hold-for-all fix | hung 600 s | 20+ | 32k+ | 3 | 3 | 3 | – | 1 |
| `18-fanout-delivered`, after it | 1/1 | 22 | 36k | 3 | 3 | 3 | – | 1 |

What the sweep showed, and what changed because of it (same day, after the
first sweep; `18` re-run on the fixed binary):

- **Neither model delegates or plans on its own.** With the agents group on
  and the new descriptions, gemma4 started 0 children in 4/4 cases and
  gpt-oss 0 in 4/4, `use.plan` on or off. A system-prompt nudge got one
  child in one case (15), which took the *whole* task and waited. No run ever
  put text before its first tool call: gemma4 answers tool calls with empty
  content and gpt-oss keeps its reasoning in `reasoning`, so the plan
  sentence — in the description *or* in the system prompt — had no
  measurable effect on these two models. It costs 209 characters per call
  (11,978 vs 11,769 of schema). The toggle stays, on by default as asked;
  the measurement says it is worth checking on a model that does write
  before calling before paying for it everywhere.
- **The mechanics work when asked for.** Case 17: reply #1 carried three
  `agent_start … wait:false`; stderr shows `↳ coder.worker started` for #2,
  #3, #4 before the first `← Started` line, and the three children's first
  model calls share a timestamp (+1.7 s). 22 calls, 13.7 s, solved.
- [x] **The start result told the model to poll**, so gemma4 called
  `agent_result` three times (concurrently — a blocking wait for all three)
  and the delivery path was never exercised in 17. `startedResult` now says
  the answer arrives as a message and that `agent_result` collects it sooner.
- [x] **Resuming on the first delivery was wrong.** In 18 the parent's turn
  restarted when #3 and #4 had delivered and #2 was a second away; gemma4
  then streamed "Still waiting for Agent #2's result." 4,857 times in one
  model call for ten minutes. `awaitChildren` now holds until every live
  child has delivered (a person's message still breaks in), so one turn
  takes all the answers: the re-run solves 18 in 10.6 s and 22 calls, and
  the same rule saves a model turn per child everywhere.
- [x] **The identical-call guard tripped on legitimate test re-runs** (plan
  on, case 14): the model ran the same test command after each of three
  fixes and the fourth was refused, tools withdrawn (5,504 → 2,877 prompt
  tokens); the case passed only because the third fix was already in. A
  successful call to a tool that is not read-only now restarts the count of
  every *other* call, so `patch, test, patch, test…` never trips and
  `test, test, test, test` still does.
- [x] **`wait:false` never reached the iOS app.** `AgentTooling.normalizeValues`
  dropped every optional `false` as "the default"; `wait` defaults to true.
  Only a parameter whose description says "default: false" loses it now, and
  the iOS end-to-end test for the delivery path is a plain test.
- [x] **Every child paid for the agent family.** The one delegated child saw
  `agent_*` besides its three narrowed tools (4,185 characters of schema,
  ~1k tokens per child call) and no run went deeper than one level. A parent
  that narrows `tools` and leaves the agent family out now gets a leaf; a
  parent that does not narrow still gets a peer, as asked.

### Still open

- [ ] **Nothing bounds one runaway generation.** The 18 hang was a single
  model call that never ended (never logged, so 19,657 lines of stdout and
  nothing in the proxy log). `limits.maxSeconds` is per run and the bench
  sets none; a per-call cap — apply `maxSeconds` to a single call, or a
  maximum of output tokens — is cheap and would have cut it at once.
- [ ] **gpt-oss empty-reply loop.** After one `The provider returned an
  empty response.` (retried 2×) it answered 34 consecutive one-token replies
  until `maxModelTurns` 40 (~60k prompt tokens); the tools were withdrawn at
  the third but the run went on. Three empty replies in a row should end the
  run, not just drop the tools.
- [ ] **Retries are too short for the cloud.** Four HTTP 500s on the parent
  in `17`/gpt-oss exhausted `retry.attempts` 2 × 5 s and failed the run while
  a child had just finished (`↲ done · 12 turns · 7 tools · 16.9k tok`);
  its work was discarded with the parent. gpt-oss also invented
  `list_available_tools` and `files_tree`.
- [ ] **The family costs +741 tokens on every call** of every process that
  sees it (11,978 vs 9,015 characters of schema): 141k vs 113k prompt tokens
  for the 4-case sweep with the same outcome. The depth limit and the
  narrowed-leaf rule keep it off the leaves; the default `maxSubagentDepth`
  of 2 still gives every first-level worker the four schemas.
- [ ] **Children list the tree first.** Every child of 17/18 opened with
  `run_sh "ls -R"` although the brief named the files. One sentence in the
  brief template ("the paths above exist; do not list the tree to find
  them") is cheap to measure.
- [ ] Sequential calls after a concurrent one in the same reply do not wait
  for it: a `files_write` after an `agent_start` runs while the child runs.
  That is what fan-out wants; a model that expects the child's file before
  its own next call would race. Nothing tripped on it yet; the description
  says nothing about it.
- [ ] A delivery shows on the terminal as the child's `↲ done` block, not as
  text in the parent's stream; a `ui.subagents` level that prints the
  delivered answer under the parent may read better.
- [ ] `analyze.py`'s `prefix Δ` compares consecutive requests of *different*
  processes once children run concurrently (16–19 in 17/18): group by
  process before comparing.
