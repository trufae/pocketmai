# Agents and subagents

How MaiCore runs work in child agents, why it does, and what the API looks like
from the outside. This is the design reference; `MaiCore/README.md` covers the
configuration file and `PLUGIN_API.md` covers tools.

## The problem

A chat with tools grows fast. Every call the model makes appends a tool-call
message and a tool-result message to the *main* transcript, and every following
turn re-sends all of it. Reading six files to answer one question can cost more
context than the answer is worth, and the noise stays in the window for the rest
of the conversation.

The context is also undifferentiated. A model deciding "which file holds the
parser?" needs the file listing; the model writing the final answer does not.
Both see everything.

Subagents fix both. A child runs the noisy part in its own transcript, returns
one answer, and disappears. The parent's transcript grows by a single tool
result instead of a dozen messages, and the parent never sees the intermediate
mess.

## Two vocabularies, deliberately kept apart

**An agent definition is a program. An agent process is a running instance.**

| | Definition | Process |
|---|---|---|
| Type | `AgentDefinition` | `AgentProcessInfo` |
| Identity | a string id (`researcher`) | a **pid** (`#4`) |
| Lives in | `pmai.json` under `agents` | the `AgentSupervisor`, for one session |
| Carries | description, provider, model, prompt, tools, limits | state, parent, transcript, usage, attention |
| Listed by | `/agents list` | `/agents tree` |

A definition is also the unit people switch between: rather than changing
provider, then model, then system prompt, then the tool set one command at a
time, `/agent use researcher` swaps all of them at once. That makes a definition
a **preset**, and two fields exist for that role:

- **`description`** — one line saying what the setup is for. People read it when
  picking; a delegating model reads the same line to choose an agent for a task,
  so it is written as a capability ("reads code and finds definitions"), not as
  a label ("Researcher v2").
- **`enabled`** — a parked setup stays in the file and stays listed, but is
  hidden from pickers and never offered as a subagent. Deleting a setup you
  might want next week is worse than hiding it.

Both are edited from every host: `/agents describe ID TEXT` and
`/agents enable|disable ID` in the REPL, the Agents tab in visual mode, and the
same `MaiConfiguration` file the iOS app reads.

The process analogy is not decoration. `agent_start` is fork+exec, `agent_stop`
is kill, `/agents tree` is pstree, and a pid is short enough to type. One
definition can back many concurrent processes; a process always names the
definition it was started from.

## Hosts without the runtime

The family is not tied to `AgentRuntime`. `AgentProcessTools` holds the four
schemas, the parsing of an `agent_start` call, the registration and
bookkeeping of a child in the `AgentSupervisor`, and the answers to
`agent_status`, `agent_result`, and `agent_stop`; the runtime is one caller of
it. A host with a tool loop of its own brings the one thing MaiCore cannot
know — how a child actually runs — as a closure that returns an `AgentResult`,
and gets the same pids, the same queueing, and the same result wording.

PocketMai is such a host. An agent profile whose "Can spawn subagents" switch
is on sees the tools; `agent_start` without a name runs a worker with the
caller's own model and tools, and with a name runs any other profile, whose
description is what the model reads to choose it. A child is an isolated run
of the app's tool loop in a Swift task — no process, no pipe, no ACP — that
reports each turn and tool to the supervisor, holds at its next turn while
paused, and reads the messages queued for it before its next model turn. The
chat shows its children in a bar above the composer, where they can be paused,
messaged, and stopped, and their transcripts read. A chat is one process for
its whole life, registered the first time an agent tool asks for it, reopened
for every turn, and completed between them, so a background child started
three turns ago is still the chat's to collect.

## The tree

Any agent that is allowed subagents can start them, including a subagent. That
makes a tree, not a two-level parent/child split:

```
#1  main            running      3 turns · 1.2k tok
├── #2  researcher  completed    2 turns · 0.4k tok
└── #3  coder       running      5 turns · 2.1k tok
    ├── #4  worker  completed    1 turn  · 0.2k tok
    └── #5  worker  approval?    waiting on write_file
```

Depth is bounded by `limits.maxSubagentDepth`. The turn, tool, token, and time
budgets belong to one agent, not to its whole tree: every child receives a
fresh `RunBudget` from its own definition, so a parent that has handed out a
hundred tool calls through its children can still start another child, and
that child can still call its tools. Budgets used to be summed across the
tree, which is what left a late child with no tool calls at all. What bounds
the tree as a whole is the parent's own allowance — each `agent_start` is one
of its tool calls — together with the depth and the concurrency. Concurrency is
bounded by `limits.maxSubagents` per parent agent, and a child started past it
is **queued** rather than refused: the supervisor registers it in the `queued`
state and admits it, oldest first, when a sibling ends. A queued child holds no
slot and no budget; `agent_start` with `wait` false answers `Queued … as #N`
with status `queued`, a blocking start just waits, and `agent_stop` on a queued
child ends the wait like any other cancellation.

## Asynchronous calls

Two things make a tree actually run in parallel rather than one child at a
time, and both are properties of the tool call, not of the model.

**A concurrent tool call is started, not awaited.** `ToolAnnotations.concurrent`
marks a tool whose calls the run starts and leaves running while it goes on to
the next call of the same reply; the results still join the transcript in call
order once the last of them is in. The four `agent_*` tools are concurrent, so
a reply that carries three `agent_start` calls starts three children at once
and blocks only until the last of them has answered — the parent never waits
for one child to finish before starting the next. A tool that writes what a
later call reads stays sequential, which is the default; a plugin may mark its
own long, independent calls concurrent in the same way.

**A child started with `wait: false` reports by itself.** The start answers at
once with a pid, and when the child ends its answer — or the reason it ended
without one — is posted to the parent's inbox as a user-role message, in the
same step as the process is marked finished, and read at the parent's next
model turn like anything a person queued (`AgentProcessTools.deliveredChildPID`
tells the two apart; the runtime marks such a child collected and emits
`childFinished` for it, never `userMessage`). A parent never polls.
`agent_result` still exists for taking the answer early; doing so drops the
pending delivery so nothing is read twice.

**A run does not end with children still working.** When the model answers
with no tool calls while one of its children is alive, the run holds
(`AgentProcessTools.awaitChildren`) until every live child has delivered —
one more model turn takes all the answers in, rather than one turn per child,
which is what a model waiting for "the third one" needs — unless a person's
message arrives first, and then asks the model once more, so the final answer
accounts for every child it started. This is what lets a one-shot `pmai "…"`
fan out without exiting on
top of its own children, and what keeps a worker from answering its parent
while its grandchildren are still running. A run out of turns ends anyway and
leaves the delivery queued for the next turn on the same pid, which is how a
chat still owns a child started three turns ago.

## Limits pause, they do not fail

A run that reaches `limits.maxModelTurns`, `limits.maxTotalTokens`, or
`limits.maxSeconds` stops at its next turn boundary — after the tool results of
the last reply, never between a call and its answer — and returns an
`AgentResult` whose `interruption` says which limit it was and whose transcript
is whole. Running that transcript again, on the same pid, picks the task up with
a fresh budget; pmai does this with `/continue`, and by itself when `yolo` is on
and the limit was the turn budget (a checkpoint), never for the token and time
caps a person set to bound the spend. The deadline also cuts a model call
short, and a tool call that would start past it is answered with an error
instead of run. A child that pauses reports to its parent as an error carrying
its last message, and shows as `stopped` in the tree. Failed model calls are
repeated under the agent's `retry` policy first, each announced with
`AgentEvent.retrying`.

## Saved with the chat

The process table lives for one session, but a chat does not. What a child
was told, which tools it called, and how it ended would otherwise be gone the
moment pmai exits, and `pmai -r` would reopen a chat whose runs had started a
dozen agents with nothing to show for them but the answers folded into the
main transcript.

So a chat file carries an `AgentProcessRecord` for every process its runs
started: what `AgentProcessInfo` knew — agent, task, state, depth, turns,
tools, tokens, failure, timestamps — plus the transcript. It is the same shape
the debug export writes as `subagents`, so an export and a saved chat agree.
Pids are session-scoped, so a record keeps them only as they were; `runID` is
its durable identity, and `parentRunID` names the record it hangs off (nil
for a direct child of the chat's own process), which is what lets a tree
restore under fresh pids.

`AgentSupervisor.records(under:)` takes the subtree of a chat's process as
records, parents before children, and `AgentProcessRecord.merging(saved:current:)`
folds them into what the chat already holds: a process the table still has
replaces its saved copy, a new one is appended, and one the table has since
forgotten — past its retention, or from an earlier session — stays as saved.
pmai does this whenever it writes the workspace: at the end of every turn,
before `/chat` and every other command, at exit, and after a one-shot run.

`AgentSupervisor.restore(_:under:)` puts records back under a chat's process
with fresh pids, once per chat and session, without ever running them: a
process that was still running when it was saved is listed as `killed` with
"its run ended with the session that started it" as its reason. From there
they are ordinary finished processes. `/agents tree` lists them, `/agents log
PID` and `agent_status` with `log` read their transcripts, `agent_result`
explains that the answer is in the transcript rather than waiting, and `/chat
info` counts them. pmai restores them as soon as a chat is opened — at start
with `-r`, or on `/chat use` — and says so.

Records are purged two ways. `/agents clear` forgets the finished processes
and drops every record of the chat at the prompt that the table no longer
holds, so what stays in the file is what the tree still shows. `/clear` and
`/chat clear` drop them with the conversation, and forget the finished
processes under the chat so the next save does not bring them back; children
still running keep going and are saved again when they end.

## Autocompact

An agent with `autocompact.tokens` above zero has its conversation summarized
by the runtime, before a model turn, once it is estimated to hold that many
tokens — the provider's own input count from the last call when it reports
one, the character count otherwise. Everything except the system prompt and
the newest exchange is folded into one summary message through the same
`prompts.compact` template `/chat compact` uses, with a built-in focus on
finishing the task in hand; the outcome arrives as `transcriptEdited`, or
`compactionFailed` when the model produced nothing, in which case the run
carries on unchanged. The threshold is absolute because context windows differ
per model and few providers say how big theirs is.

**Scoping rule:** a process may only address pids inside its own subtree. `#3`
can stop `#5`; it cannot stop `#1` or inspect `#2`. This is enforced in the
supervisor, not in the prompt.

## The three-part brief

The parent — not the framework — decides what a child needs to know. That is the
whole token argument: the parent has the conversation, so only the parent can
say which 200 words of it matter. `agent_start` therefore takes three separate
fields rather than one blob:

1. **`context`** — what the child must know that it cannot discover. Facts
   already established, decisions already made, paths already found.
2. **`task`** — the single thing to do. One task per process.
3. **`output`** — what to return, and in what shape. "A list of file paths, one
   per line, no prose." The parent is the consumer, so the parent writes the
   contract.

Splitting them beats one free-form prompt for two reasons. The model fills three
labelled slots more reliably than it writes a well-structured brief, and the
host can render them through a template it controls.

That template is the **delegation prompt**: a built-in default in MaiCore,
overridable per installation under `prompts.delegation` in the configuration and
editable with `/edit delegation`. Placeholders: `{{context}}`, `{{task}}`,
`{{output}}`, `{{agent}}`, `{{cwd}}`. Rendering happens in MaiCore, so pmai,
PocketMai, and any other host produce identical child prompts.

The child's transcript is exactly two messages: its definition's instructions as
system, and the rendered brief as user. Nothing from the parent leaks in
implicitly.

## Delegation mode: where tools actually run

`AgentDefinition.toolDelegation` decides whether an agent runs tools itself.

- **`inline`** (default, and what MaiCore has always done) — the agent sees its
  configured tools and calls them in its own transcript.
- **`subagent`** — the agent keeps its concrete tools and is offered the
  `agent_*` family as well when its `agents` tool group is enabled. It can run a
  small call itself and send bulky work one level down, to a child that is
  discarded afterwards. Which tools an agent has is always its definition's
  list, whatever its depth in the tree.

The switch is off by default. Turning it on changes how the main agent thinks
about its work, costs an extra model round-trip per delegated task, and is worth
it only when tool output is bulky. It is set per agent with `/set delegation`,
persisted into the agent's definition, and readable and writable from the iOS
app through the same `MaiConfiguration` file.

### The derived worker

`subagent` mode with no configured subagents would give an agent nothing to
delegate to. So when the parent does not name a child definition, MaiCore
derives one: **`<parent>.worker`**, same provider and model, inheriting the
parent's tool allow-list, its delegation mode and its subagents, and taking its
instructions from the delegation prompt. A worker is a peer of its parent: it
can hand part of its task down in turn, and `limits.maxSubagentDepth` is what
stops the recursion; a parent that narrows the child's `tools` and leaves the
agent family out gets a leaf, since it said what the child may use. At the
depth limit the agent tools are not offered at all
(the child could not start anything, so the four schemas would be paid on every
call for nothing), which also keeps the leaves of a deep tree cheap.

This is what makes the feature usable without configuration: switch delegation
on and the existing agent keeps working, with the option of moving bulky tool
traffic one level down, and a level below that when a piece of work is itself
too big for one context.

Naming a real definition instead (`agent: "researcher"`) is how you get a
*different* model or a *narrower* tool set for the child — a cheap local model
for grep-shaped work, an expensive one for the synthesis.

## Choosing the agent

Same idea as choosing a tool: the caller may pick, or the model may pick.

The `agent` parameter of `agent_start` is a JSON Schema `enum` built from the
caller's `subagentNames`, with each definition's `displayName` in the
description. So the model selects an agent the same way it selects a tool, from
a list it can see, and an unknown name is rejected before anything starts.
Omitting the parameter falls back to the derived worker.

## The tool family

All four are native, reserved names in the `agents` tool group. They are only
offered when that group is enabled for the running agent and its
`limits.maxSubagents` is greater than zero. `/tools enable agents` and `/tools
disable agents` change that permission on the current agent; `/agent tools ID
+agents` and `-agents` change another saved agent.

| Tool | Arguments | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_start` | `agent?`, `context`, `task`, `output`, `wait?`, `tools?` | pid, plus the answer when `wait`; without `wait`, the answer arrives later as a message |
| `agent_status` | `pid?`, `tree?`, `log?` | one process, or the caller's subtree; with `pid` and `log`, that agent's recent transcript |
| `agent_result` | `pid`, `wait?` | final answer, usage, stop reason; a child that stopped without answering returns the end of its transcript |
| `agent_stop` | `pid`, `reason?` | what was stopped |

`wait` defaults to **true**: the parent blocks until the child answers. That is
the common case — the parent delegates, waits, and continues with one clean
result — and because the call is concurrent, several starts in one reply are
already a fan-out. `wait: false` returns a pid immediately and the answer is
delivered to the parent's inbox when the child ends (see *Asynchronous calls*);
`agent_result` collects it sooner when the parent cannot go on without it.

The descriptions carry the guidance a model needs to use the family well: a
child is self-contained (it cannot see the conversation, so `context` must
carry what it needs), one concrete task each, independent tasks started in
the same reply, and a child may start children of its own. With `use.plan` on
(`/set use.plan`, the default) `agent_start` also asks for a short numbered
plan before the first delegation of a request with several steps, saying which
steps go to children and which of those run in parallel; a single question
gets no plan. The sentence lives in the tool description, so it costs nothing
for an agent that cannot start children.

`agent_stop` kills a subtree, not just one node, because a half-stopped tree
leaks running work nobody is waiting for.

`spawn_agent` and `agent_launch` remain as aliases for the blocking and
background forms, so existing configurations keep working.

## States and attention

```
starting → running → completed
   ↑          │  ╲
 queued       │   ╲→ failed
              │    ╲→ cancelled
              │     ╲→ interrupted (a limit paused it; the transcript is whole)
              ↓
    waitingForApproval · waitingForInput · blocked(reason) · paused
```

A background process that needs a human is invisible unless something says so.
The supervisor keeps one **attention** slot per pid:

- `.approval(tool, call)` — a tool call is waiting for a yes or no
- `.input(prompt)` — the process asked its user something
- `.error(message)` — a network failure or interruption stopped progress
- `.finished(summary)` — a background result nobody has collected yet

Approvals set the slot *before* the approval handler is consulted and clear it
after, so a process blocked on a synchronous prompt still shows as
`approval?` in `/agents tree`.

Hosts observe `AgentSupervisor.events`, an `AsyncStream<AgentSupervisorEvent>`.
pmai prints a line when a background process raises attention; PocketMai can
badge it. Neither polls.

## Steering a running process

Waiting for a turn to end before saying "not that file, the other one" wastes
the turn. Every process therefore has an **inbox**: `AgentSupervisor.post(_:to:)`
queues a user message for a pid, and the run reads its inbox at the top of
every model turn — after the tool results the model is about to see — appending
each message to the transcript and emitting `AgentEvent.userMessage`. A message
that lands while the model is producing its final answer does not get lost:
the loop goes round once more so the answer reflects it, unless the turn
budget is spent, in which case the message stays queued for the host.

A chat's own process is registered before its first turn with
`AgentRuntime.allocateProcess(agentID:)`, so messages can wait for a chat that
is idle too; pmai folds them into the next turn it starts. Queued messages are
editable until they are read: `discardLastQueuedMessage`, `discardQueuedMessage(id:)`,
and `clearQueuedMessages` back `/queue pop` and `/queue drop`, and
`AgentProcessInfo.queuedMessages` shows the count in a listing.

Children report through the same event handler as their parent, background or
not, with their own pid in the context. pmai turns that into blocks prefixed
`agent#N` — a child's text is held until a tool call, the next turn, or the end
of its run, then printed whole, so two children never interleave mid-line —
and `ui.subagents` chooses `all`, `tools`, `stats`, or `none`. The ACP server
forwards only depth-0 events to the editor.

```

Turning delegation on with no subagent budget would silently do nothing, so
`/set delegation subagent` raises `limits.maxSubagents` to 1 and says it did.

Visual mode carries the same three surfaces: the Agents tab lists setups with
their description and an Enable/Disable button, the focused chat has a "May
delegate tool work" toggle, and a Running agents pane draws the live tree with
a Stop button per row.

## Cost model

What delegation actually buys, for a task that reads six files:

| | inline | subagent |
|---|---|---|
| Main-transcript growth | 6 calls + 6 results (~4k tok) | 1 call + 1 result (~200 tok) |
| Model round-trips | 7 | 8 (one extra for the brief) |
| Cost of the *next* turn | carries all 4k | carries 200 |

The extra round-trip is paid once; the saved context is paid back on every
subsequent turn of the conversation. Delegation therefore wins on long chats
with bulky tools and loses on short chats with terse ones — which is why it is
a per-agent setting and not a global default.

## PocketMai (iOS) — not built yet

PocketMai does not read `MaiConfiguration`; it has its own `AppSettings` with
`ProviderKind`, `OpenAIEndpoint`, `SystemPrompt`, `BuiltInToolID`, and MCP
selections. So it cannot adopt `AgentDefinition` directly, and the preset idea
has to be expressed in its own vocabulary:

```swift
struct AgentPreset: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
  var id: UUID
  var name: String
  var description: String        // what it is for; also what a model reads to pick it
  var isEnabled: Bool            // parked, not deleted
  var provider: ProviderKind
  var endpointID: UUID?          // when provider is .openAI
  var modelID: String?
  var systemPromptID: UUID?
  var enabledTools: Set<BuiltInToolID>
  var enabledMCPServers: Set<UUID>
  var enabledMCPTools: Set<String>
  var toolCallingMode: ToolCallingMode?
  var reasoningLevel: ReasoningLevel?
  var maxToolCallsPerTurn: Int?
  var toolDelegation: AgentToolDelegation   // shared with MaiCore
}
```

The work is: those fields plus `agentPresets` and `selectedAgentPresetID` on
`AppSettings`; an `apply(_:to:)` that writes a preset onto a `Conversation` the
way the individual pickers do today; a settings screen that lists, reorders,
describes, enables, and duplicates presets; and a picker in the chat header so
switching setups is one tap instead of four screens. The description field is
what makes automatic selection possible later, exactly as it does in MaiCore.

This is not implemented. `PocketMai/Models/ChatModels.swift`,
`PocketMai/Stores/AppStore.swift`, and `PocketMai/Stores/PersistenceStore.swift`
— the three files it needs — are being rewritten in the working tree by other
work in progress, and landing a second large change into them would collide.

## What is deliberately not here

- **Processes do not survive a restart.** Pids are session-scoped. Persisting a
  half-finished child means persisting a provider connection, and a resumed
  child would answer a question the parent has forgotten. Within a session a
  chat keeps one pid across all its turns, which is what makes a background
  child started three turns ago still collectable.
- **Children do not share the parent's transcript.** Everything a child knows
  arrived through its brief. This is what keeps the cost model honest.
- **No inter-sibling messaging.** `#2` cannot talk to `#3`. Coordination goes
  through the parent, which is the only process with the whole picture.
